                <div class="steps">
                    <!-- Step 1 -->
                    <div class="step">
                        <p>Introduce yourself by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@outbacknursery.ca">info@outbacknursery.ca</a>
                            <button class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleDetail('detail1')">+</button>
                        </p>
                        <div id="detail1" class="detail" style="display:none;">
                            This step is asking you to initiate contact with Outback Nursery by sending them an email. The email address provided, info@outbacknursery.ca, is where you should send your message. When you send the email, you should introduce yourself, provide any necessary details, and specify the purpose of your communication. This step is essentially the first point of contact with the nursery, allowing them to know who you are and why you are reaching out to them. 
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    
                    <!-- Step 2 -->
                    <div class="step">
                        <p>Make a quick payment via E-transfer to <a href="mailto:info@outbacknursery.ca">info@outbacknursery.ca</a>, specifying your chosen amount.
                            <button class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleDetail('detail2')">+</button>
                        </p>
                        <div id="detail2" class="detail" style="display:none;">
                            Once you've made contact and established what you want to purchase or the service you're interested in, the next step is to make a payment. In this case, they are asking you to make a payment via E-transfer to the same email address, info@outbacknursery.ca. E-transfer is a secure and convenient way to transfer funds electronically from your bank account to the recipient's account. When making the transfer, you need to specify the amount you are paying, ensuring that it matches the agreed-upon price for the product or service.

                    <div class="step">
                        <p>Sit back and relax as we prepare your personalized voucher. We'll scan and email it directly to you or to a recipient of your choice.

                        <div id="detail3" class="detail" style="display:none;">
                            After you've made the payment, Outback Nursery will process your order or service request. In this step, they are letting you know that they will prepare a personalized voucher for you. This voucher could be for various purposes, such as a gift certificate, discount coupon, or proof of purchase. Once the voucher is ready, they will scan it and send it to you via email. Alternatively, if you're purchasing the voucher as a gift for someone else, they can send it directly to the recipient's email address. This step assures you that once you've completed the payment, they will take care of the rest and ensure you receive your voucher promptly.
